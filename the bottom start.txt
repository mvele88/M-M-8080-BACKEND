# --- For Blockonomics BTC Balance (Wallet Watcher) ---
BLOCKONOMICS_API_KEY="YOUR_BLOCKONOMICS_API_KEY"
# This is crucial for the backend to fetch REAL BTC balance.
# You need to provide an Extended Public Key (xPub) from your Bitcoin wallet,
# or a specific Bitcoin address that Blockonomics can monitor.

# --- For Blockonomics BTC Withdrawal (Requires Self-Hosted Wallet Service) ---
# To make REAL BTC withdrawals via Blockonomics API, you typically need to
# run their self-hosted 'wallet_service' (https://github.com/blockonomics/wallet_service).
# The URL below should point to YOUR deployed instance of that wallet_service.
# This is NOT a public Blockonomics API for sending.

BLOCKONOMICS_WALLET_ID="YOUR_BLOCKONOMICS_WALLET_SERVICE_WALLET_ID" # This is defined when you set up wallet_service

BLOCKONOMICS_API_PASSWORD_FOR_SEND="YOUR_OPTIONAL_API_PASSWORD_FOR_WALLET_SERVICE_SEND_FUNCTION" # If you configured an API password specifically for sending within your wallet_service config

# --- For Actual SOL to BTC Conversion Trigger (Transfer to Exchange) ---
# This is the deposit address on a centralized exchange (e.g., Binance, Coinbase)
# where you would send SOL to convert it to BTC.

# --- For Firebase/Firestore (Canvas provides these, but listing for completeness) ---
# Note: Canvas runtime automatically injects __app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token
# You typically DO NOT need to set these in your .env for Canvas deployments.
# However, for local testing outside Canvas, you might need them.
